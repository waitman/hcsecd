This is hcsecd modified by Waitman Gobble <ns@waitman.net>

It supports two additional pin modes besides specifying the pin in the configuration file.
"PROMPT" mode and "BRIG" mode.


1. PROMPT pin mode

PROMPT mode is useful if the connecting client generates a random pin code which must be 
entered on the server. For example, if you have an HID device. GNU/Linux,Android and Mac OS X
clients require this mode. MS Windows clients may be set to this mode manually using the 
"Generate PIN code" option while pairing the client.

Set pin to "PROMPT"

# cat /etc/bluetooth/hcsecd.conf 
device {
        bdaddr  00:00:00:00:00:00;
        name    "Default entry";
        key     nokey;
        pin     "PROMPT";
}

When you pair device, it prompts for pin code..
hcsecd will block until FIFO gets data. (or requesting device times out)

echo "835753" > /tmp/pinprompt

FIFO name is set as /tmp/pinprompt at top of hcsecd.c



2. BRIG pin mode

BRIG mode is useful if you wish to identify the BDADDR with specific identity records,
for example, a phone number. When using BRIG mode, set the pin key in the file /tmp/brig.txt.
Note that the file will be deleted once it has been used.

BRIG mode example:

device {
        bdaddr  00:00:00:00:00:00;
        name    "Default entry"; 
        key     nokey;
        pin     "BRIG";
}

# printf "5108307975" > /tmp/brig.txt

In the debug log:

Mar 28 08:38:39 afia hcsecd[61760]: Sending PIN_Code_Reply '5108307975' to 'ubt1hci' 
 for remote bdaddr bc:44:86:13:0f:ff
